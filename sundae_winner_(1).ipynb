I am not sure if that's okay but it just made more sense. Then I needed to change name of each customer and winner word followed by number, and I also made sure they are aligning throughout the program. It took me a fair bit of time to fix the syntaxes but I realized I was missing the + symbol. Once I finally got the program running, my names had no space in between words, then I fixed it inside the strings and got it running properly. I hope my explanation makes sense and this is roughly correct. \n"
